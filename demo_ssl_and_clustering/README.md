# Demo for SSL and clustering 

This is a small example of how you can use self-supervised learning to learn a descriptive feature representation of images and apply a TSNE transform to cluster the resulting representations. The output is a npz-file that can be used with icat. Note that there is a separate requirements-file for the demo.


You need to cd into this folder (demo_ssl_and_clustering) in order to have the code working.
